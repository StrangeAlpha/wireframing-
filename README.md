# Wireframes 
Wireframes are essential tools in the design process, helping teams visualize structure, flow, and functionality before development begins. The level of fidelity determines how detailed and polished the wireframe is.
This is the wireframing for the ALX Airbnb
Will be working on creating a structure wireframe for the project. 

# Layout Structure
# Navigation
# Content Placement
# Functionality


# Low-Fidelity Wireframes
Low-fidelity wireframes are simple, quick, and conceptual.
They focus on layout and information hierarchy rather than design details.

# High-Fidelity Wireframes
High-fidelity wireframes are detailed and polished, closely resembling the final product.
They demonstrate visual design, interactivity, and user flow.

# Wireframe Tools 
# Figma
Figma is one of the most popular and versatile tools for wireframing and UI/UX design. It’s a browser-based, collaborative design platform that allows teams to create, share, and iterate on wireframes and prototypes in real time.
